# CSCU9X5-Assignment

## The Idea

I will be creating a web application which will be An interactive instructional course about basic algorithms to help people learn how to program in fun ways. 
This will be done by:
- An online editor and compiler where a user can try to solve the solution.
    - solutions to create the code
    - solutions which you need to find and fix bugs
    - expected outcomes which will toggle a score and tell you if you are right or wrong
